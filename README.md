## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

This is the first mentor frontend challenge I've done, I learned a bit of flexbox and some commands using the terminal. I want to learn more about how to use git in the future to save my changes little by little

### Continued development

At this point I am trying to use what I have learned about html and css, at the same time I am learning javascript concepts, I hope in the future to start doing small projects using this language.
